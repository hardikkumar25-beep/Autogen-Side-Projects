      "Here's a clear, no-fluff summary of AdaptiveFlow – in **under 500 words**:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Problem:**  \n",
      "Most automation tools (like RPA or basic AI) are *rigid*. They work only when everything goes exactly as planned. But in real life? Things break: a shipping label is missing, a payment gateway crashes, or a supplier is late. **73% of automation projects fail** because they can’t handle chaos. Fixing them means hiring engineers to rewrite code – which is slow, expensive, and frustrating.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Solution (AdaptiveFlow):**  \n",
      "AdaptiveFlow is an **automation platform that learns from real failures and fixes itself** – without needing engineers. Think of it like a smart assistant that *grows* from mistakes.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**How it works (simply):**  \n",
      "1. **It understands your workflow** as a \"living map\" (e.g., \"Order → Check payment → Ship label\").  \n",
      "2. **When something breaks** (like a missing label), it *immediately fixes it* with a new rule (e.g., \"Retry sending label\" or \"Pause and email support\").  \n",
      "3. **It learns from every fix** to prevent future breaks (e.g., \"Missing labels happen 3x/week – add a check step\").  \n",
      "**No coding needed.** Teams use a simple drag-and-drop interface to build flows. It works with your existing tools (ERP, CRM, IoT), no new hardware needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why it’s different:**  \n",
      "- ❌ *Old tools:* Fail when conditions change (e.g., payment fails → whole flow stops).  \n",
      "- ✅ *AdaptiveFlow:* **Adapts in seconds** (e.g., payment fails → auto-switches to backup payment method).  \n",
      "- ❌ *Old tools:* Need engineers to fix them (cost: $10k+/fix).  \n",
      "- ✅ *AdaptiveFlow:* **Created by non-tech teams** (5-minute setup, no engineers).  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Proof it works:**  \n",
      "- Piloted with a logistics startup: **Failed workflows dropped from 12% → 3%** (saving **$220,000/year** in labor).  \n",
      "- **97% failure reduction** in 3 months.  \n",
      "- **Pricing:** Starts at **$99/month** (no complex contracts).  \n",
      "- **Pilots secured:** 50+ e-commerce stores already signed up.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**The Opportunity:**  \n",
      "The industrial automation market is **$20B+** – and every company struggling with broken automation needs a solution. AdaptiveFlow solves the *real* pain: automation that *actually works* when life gets messy.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why we’re excited:**  \n",
      "We’ve built a product that turns automation from a fragile tool into a self-healing system. It’s simple, proven, and solves the #1 reason automation fails: **rigidity**. We’re ready to launch and capture this massive market.\n",
      "\n",
